# Udacity FEND Restaurant Reviews App
---
## Project Overview
This is Udacity Front End Developer Project - Restaurant Reviews. There were three major tasks to handle:
- Build a responsive webpage with css (flexbox or css grid)
- Implement accessibility features
- Add service worker

Here is detailed description:

> You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop 
> browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at 
> all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 




### How to run the website?
Download or clone the repository. Then, do follow this steps:

> 1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools > to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

> In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m 
> SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server > 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the 
> software.

> 2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current 
> experience looks like.
